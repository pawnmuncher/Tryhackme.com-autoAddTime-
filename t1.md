6.2. Understand Privacy Issues, Including Jurisdictional Variation

<a id="anno04GrO"></a>As discussed in Lesson 10, "Legal and Compliance Part 1," the impact of the decentralized, geographically, and geopolitically dispersed model of cloud computing presents numerous challenges, including these:  

- Data processing, storage, and computing, each occurring in different geopolitical realms
- Difficulties in assessing data actors
- Difficulties in locating data

A great deal of the difficulty in managing the legal ramifications of cloud computing stems from the design of cloud assets. They are necessarily dispersed, often across county, state, and even international borders. Resources are constantly being allocated and reallocated on a moment-to-moment basis. Also, specific control and administration of particular assets can be hard to ascertain and establish.  
  
It is that transborder aspect that is most troublesome, in terms of allowing the cloud customer to maintain compliance with legal and regulatory mandates. As we discussed in the previous lesson, each jurisdiction can have its own governance, which can vary wildly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and jurisdictions can overlap. A city is in a county is in a state, which is in a country, and they might all have conflicting guidance and interests. Moreover, legislation and guidance is always in flux, especially in our industry. Lawmakers and standards bodies are constantly trying to catch up to the requirements and questions posed by new technologies and how those technologies are used. And these vagaries of law affect not only the cloud customer, in terms of how the customer must behave and respond to legal action, but also how the cloud provider must perform in response to these same stimuli.  
  
The governance used by both entities—the cloud customer and the cloud provider—must take all of this into account in order to operate reasonably with acknowledgment of legal risks and liabilities in the cloud.

<a id="04Gro"></a>

#### Policies

<a id="anno04Gro"></a>

Policies are one of the foundational elements of a governance and risk management program. They guide the organization, based on standards and guidelines. Policies ensure that the organization is operating within its risk profile. Policies actually define, or are the expression of, the organization's risk tolerance.  
  

Risk Appetite and Risk Tolerance

There are two aspects of every decision involving risk. The first is the potential benefit a decision offers, and the other is the opportunity associated with it. Banks loan money to people with good credit because the opportunity to make a profit from the interest on the loan outweighs the risk of the person defaulting on the loan. As the risk of default goes up, so does the interest rate until a point is reached where the risk is so high that a loan cannot even be obtained.  
  
In the financial world, risk appetite and risk tolerance are very well understood. These are the drivers of Wall Street and every company in the world. Each day, businesses make decisions about risks they are either willing or not willing to take. People and businesses weigh the benefits of the opportunities against the risk of the same action. These activities are the expression of their willingness or not to take risk, generally called their *risk tolerance*. When engaging in risk tolerance, people and businesses consider how far they will go in taking risk before the potential risk outweighs the opportunity.  
  
A more personal example of a risk decision based on risk versus opportunity might be the decision to climb up on the roof of your house to clean out the gutters. At age 35, this may seem like a simple task and you are very willing to take the risk of falling as you are pretty sure of yourself and your ability to maintain your balance. The benefit is that your gutters will be clean and not become clogged when it rains, as well as the cost savings you realize for not having to hire someone else to perform the task for you. However, at age 60, would you be willing to take the same risk? If you fell, you might lose the ability to do your job, costing you a great deal of money, and your balance is not what it once was. The cost of lost work is probably a lot less than the cost of hiring someone to clean the gutters in your stead (assuming that, by age 60, you make more money, per hour, than someone who is younger and earns money cleaning gutters).In other words, the benefit of having clean gutters may not be outweighed any longer by your willingness to risk falling. If, not, then your risk appetite (or conversely risk tolerance) has changed over time.  
  
Working with businesses in the cloud is much the same in that they each have their own particular risk appetite and tolerance based on their individual situations. Some may be willing to have data spread across the world, whereas others may not. Some may be tightly regulated, disallowing them from taking certain risks, and others may be willing to skimp on security in the belief that it makes them more nimble. What is important to remember is that everyone is different and has different tolerances for risk and that tolerance can change over time or very quickly depending on circumstances.

  
Before the organization begins creating its policies, we start by identifying the stakeholders. This ensures that we have the right individuals involved in creating the expression of risk tolerance. These can include:  

- Business unit leaders
- The board of directors
- Investors
- Regulators

The views, perceptions, and choices of these groups will influence the organization's willingness and ability to accept risk, but most of these stakeholders will not be directly involved in crafting organizational policy. For instance, the regulators won't (or shouldn't) help draft policy, but the regulations and regulators' enforcement of them establish how an organization can take risks and what risks it is allowed to take. The regulators, ostensibly acting on behalf of lawmakers and in turn working on behalf of the public (because they chose those lawmakers), are expressing the view of the public, vis-à-vis risk, on organizations. Say the organization offered a new product, but the risk of creating that product might result in an employee dying once per month; the organization might be willing to take on that risk if the potential profits were high enough, and the employees might be willing to take on that risk if the pay was high enough, but the regulators might take a dim view of offering such a product at the possible cost of human life, so the risk appetite of the organization would necessarily be limited by regulation.  
  

Note

The decision to risk human life is not necessarily unethical or immoral. Deep sea fishing has been one of the most fatal professions in the United States for more than one hundred years, and consumers have not stopped buying seafood en masse out of protest and loathing at the potential human cost of acquiring their meals. People engaged in commercial fishing choose to risk their lives to make very good money and seem to enjoy their work, regulators mandate reasonable safety requirements for the industry, and consumers enjoy seafood.

  
Once the stakeholder inputs have been adequately identified, the organization can begin building the policies needed in order to operate safely.  
  

Note

Interestingly, the FDIC and many state banking regulators use the term *safety and soundness exams* when they perform a certain type of IT general controls audit. It refers to the idea that the financial institution should be operating with policies in place that ensure the safety and soundness of all transactions and data storage. These can be some of the most rigorous of their exams, as they look at every operational unit involved in the transacting of business. They will even look at cleaning policies and contracts to ensure that things like background checks are performed on cleaning staff because they have direct physical access to offices without supervision.  
  
Until recently, most bank examiners would have had a stroke had they come into a bank and discovered them using popular cloud services for things like email and file sharing. Today, however, that attitude has changed, and just like any business, financial services are looking for ways to save money and make their staff more productive. These are the same business drivers we have been discussing throughout the course.

  
Identifying and engaging relevant stakeholders is vital to the success of any cloud computing discussions or projects. But there are also challenges that may need to be overcome in order to effectively engage them.  
  
For instance, policies must be malleable enough to reflect changing business opportunities, requirements, and operations. This may have never been truer than in the example of an organization migrating from a legacy environment to the cloud. Almost assuredly, the organization had policies in place that acknowledged the risks and opportunities of that environment (the legacy operation) and dealt with them accordingly. However, the risks and benefits in the cloud are much different, so the policies must be revisited, the guidance and stakeholder input reexamined, and new policies generated, amended, or appended to the old policies.  
  
The variety and vagaries of multijurisdictional law make the regulatory stakeholders and their input especially complicated for cloud services and management. Instead of one regulatory framework to consider when drafting policy, the organization now must take into account every jurisdiction where the cloud provider might be storing, transmitting, and processing the organization's data, as well as every jurisdiction where any of the organization's end customers might reside. This latter part is especially troublesome, because when an organization operates on the cloud, it is assumed that the potential customer base is the web, meaning that the jurisdiction of the organization's customer is the entire planet.  
  
It would be impossible to craft pertinent policy that met the needs and requirements of every jurisdiction in the world. Too many of them inherently conflict with others. So a significant portion of the effort that goes into promulgating policy is determining which jurisdictional mandates are most likely to bear on the organization's operations, where most of the end clientele will reside, where most of the cloud functions will take place, and so forth. It's a cost–benefit analysis of a lesser scale: instead of determining whether the organization has the risk appetite to perform a given function, this part of the effort will be used to determine which laws and regulators will be most likely to impact the organization and which ones should therefore have the most bearing on the organization's policy.  
  
It should go without saying that while subject matter experts (such as the CCSP practitioner) will be called on to draft policies related to the organization's operations in the cloud, general counsel will provide an invaluable input when creating all the organization's policies. Attorneys will be the most versed in identifying, understanding, and tailoring documentation to address the multitude of jurisdictional regulation the organization might face.  
  
As mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, subject matter experts will be called on to create particular policies for the organization. These experts might be internal employees and staff of the organization. They might be external consultants hired for the purpose. The policies might be purchased from an existing set that were designed and drafted by experts in that particular area of expertise and then tailored by the organization to meet its own needs. In this regard, the CCSP should expect to be called on to offer input and advice when the organization is formalizing cloud policy.  
  
After the experts have drafted the policy, the policy must be presented to the decision makers: senior management and the board of directors. The subject matter experts may be called on to explain specific aspects of the policy, expound on particular threats and tangible benefits, and explain how these risks are being addressed by the policy. Senior management must understand these draft policies in order to make an informed decision in accepting them (and the risks and benefits they entail), or modifying the policies as they see fit. Ultimately, policy acceptance will come down to a senior manager signing the policy document and the board acknowledging their approval of the policy.  
  
Once the policy has been formally accepted, it must be published and disseminated among those affected by the policy. Communication in an enterprise environment is challenging in and of itself. Cloud computing makes this communication even more complicated because of things like the IT administration staff not being local, time zone differences between the provider and customer, and the fact that providers could have  literally thousands of other customers.  
  
Communication to other business units or departments is vitally important as well. All of the internal and external stakeholders should be kept abreast of any changes or other issues related to policies and operations. Here are some common departments that include internal stakeholders:  

- IT
- HR
- Vendor management
- Compliance
- Risk management
- Finance
- Operations

Some things that complicate communication are  

- Disparate administrative workforce
- Time zone differences
- Ignorance of cloud computing models and concepts
- Poor understanding of business drivers
- Poor understanding of the organization's risk appetite

When discussing these matters with stakeholders, remember that in all likelihood they will not have a grasp of the cloud computing concepts held by the CCSP. Therefore, it is in everyone's best interest to take things slowly and to ensure that questions get answered adequately so that everyone is on the same page. It is also the CCSP's job to educate stakeholders about cloud computing risks and benefits so that they are better able to make fact-based decisions as opposed to relying on hearsay and gossip.  
  

Note

How many times have you seen the joke on the Internet or a t-shirt that says "There is no cloud. Just other people's computers"? Many people still believe this, and tend to dumb down the conversations due to their understanding of the complexities of cloud computing. It is important that you, as the cloud-aware professional, acknowledge this and can communicate effectively to ensure an appropriate understanding of the issues surrounding cloud computing and the challenges it brings along with the business drivers and opportunities that have made it such a success.

  
Some of the policies that the organization will need to appropriately reflect the cloud computing paradigm are as follows:  

- Information security policy (ISP)
- Acceptable use policy
- Data classification policy
- Network and Internet security
- Passwords
- Antimalware policy
- Software security
- Disaster recovery and data backup
- Remote and third-party access
- Segregation of duties
- Incident response plan
- Personnel security
- Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy
- Legal compliance
- Encryption

There will be times when a cloud provider will be unable to meet an organization's internal policy requirements. When that occurs, it is imperative that these deficiencies be taken into account and managed as part of any internal governance process. This will ensure that any contract elements or SLAs agreed on will not violate the organizational policies or place the organization at undue risk outside its risk tolerance levels.

#### Implications of the Cloud for Enterprise Risk Management

Cloud computing as it exists today has commoditized compute, storage, and networking services. Enterprise risk management has shifted in response to this change. It is vitally important that both the customer and the provider focus on risk management and the challenges presented with cloud computing. The cloud customer (in the role of data owner) is ultimately responsible for ensuring control effectiveness, but stored data, security, and risk management require a partnership between the customer and provider. See Figure 11.1.

Figure 11.1: Governance Takes Usage Into Account

  
Before you explore the detailed discussion of risk management, you need to be familiar with some risk-related terms.  

- **Key Risk Indicators (KRI):** Key risk indicators are those items that will be the first things that let you know something is amiss. In the financial industry, a KRI might be the stock market cycling wildly over the course of a single day. In cloud computing, it might be the announcement of the discovery of a new vulnerability that could impact your cloud provider. The idea is that you need to identify and closely monitor the things that will most quickly alert you to a change in the risk environment.
- **Risk Appetite/Tolerance:** Risk tolerance and appetite are similar descriptors of how the organization views risk. As their appetite or tolerance increases, so does their willingness to take greater and greater risks. As it decreases, so does the associated willingness to take risk.
- **Risk Profiles:** The risk profile of the organization is a comprehensive analysis of the possible risks the organization is exposed to. The risk profile should include a survey of the various operations the organization is engaged in, public perception of the organization, pending legislation that might affect the organization, the stability of countries where the organization operates, and so forth.
- **Risk Owners and Players:** These are the individuals in the organization who together determine the organization's overall risk profile. For example, while one department may be willing to take moderately high risks in engaging cloud activities, another may have a lower risk tolerance. It is the aggregate of these individual tolerances that determines the organization's overall risk appetite.

#### Choices Involved in Managing Risk

Part of managing risk includes knowing what you want to do about it. An organization always has four choices when faced with risk:  

- Risk avoidance
- Risk acceptance
- Risk transference
- Risk mitigation

The following sections will explore each of these options further.  
  
**Risk Avoidance**  
Risk avoidance is not a method for handling risk, but a response to the cost-benefit analysis when posed with a specific risk. If an organization is faced with a risk where the potential costs far outweigh the likely benefits, the organization may choose not to engage in the activity that would incur the risk *at all*. This is the only surefire method for eliminating a specific risk: don't conduct the risky activity.  
  
For instance, if the activity is, say, taking a package across the ocean, and the risk includes such potential costs as drowning, soaking the package in seawater and rendering it worthless, losing both the package and the ship, and so on, and the potential benefit is being paid $5 to transport the package, the organization might (rightly) deem the risk not to be worth the reward and choose instead to stay out of the transoceanic delivery business. The organization can then be said to have engaged in risk avoidance.  
  
**Risk Acceptance**  
The direct opposite of risk avoidance is risk acceptance. In examining the potential benefits and risks of a certain activity, if the organization determines that the risks are minimal and the reward is substantial, the organization might choose to accept the risks involved in the endeavor and press on with the activity without any additional consideration.  
  
To use the prior example, if the organization determines that the risks of transporting a package across the ocean are so low as to be negligible (say, if there is a sufficient historical record to indicate that nobody has drowned or lost a ship or package on similar journeys in the past 10 years), and the reward is estimable (if the organization is offered $5,000 instead of $5), then the organization make take the job of moving the package without any other consideration. This is risk acceptance.  
  
To use some of the concepts of the prior discussion in this lesson, if the risk of the activity is estimated to be within the organization's *risk appetite*, then the organization might choose risk acceptance.  
  
**Risk Transference**  
Risk transference is a way to handle risk associated with an activity without accepting *all* the risk. With risk transference, the organization finds someone else to incur the potential risk of an endeavor at a fraction of the potential cost the organization would incur if the risk was realized.  
  
Basically, when you think of risk transference, think one word: insurance. The organization is going to pay a portion of what the worst outcome would be in order to insulate against the cost of that worst outcome.  
  
Back to the example from the previous sections: if the organization can buy shipping insurance for the task of delivering the package, then the worst-case scenario (someone drowning, losing the ship, and losing the package, and therefore losing the payment for transporting it) can be offset by a proportional payout from the underwriter. If the organization gets paid $5,000 to ship the package, then buys an insurance policy for $500 with terms such that failure to deliver or loss of the package results in a payout significant enough to mollify the client (the sender of the package) as well as recoup the costs the organization faces in performance (the expenses incurred in performing the activity, such as renting a boat, hiring someone to carry the package, and so on), and perhaps even an extraordinary payout in the event of an extraordinary risk being realized (the boat is attacked by sharks and everyone on board is eaten along with the package), then the reduced profit (reflecting the cost of the policy) might still be acceptable to the organization, with the additional assurance that the risks are being addressed.  
  
**Risk Mitigation**  
The final option in managing risk is risk mitigation, and this is the option that comprises the daily workload of most security practitioners. Risk mitigation is the practice of reducing risk to an acceptable level through the use of controls and countermeasures. That is to say that the organization implements controls in order to bring known risks to within that organization's risk appetite.  
  
Using the same example as in the previous sections, controls that might be implemented to reduce the risk involved with shipping a package across the sea might include putting the package in a watertight container, affixing a tracking device to the package, equipping the ship conveying the package with anticollision sensors, and so on. When the organization has determined that the significant risks have been attenuated sufficiently with the proper controls, then the organization may decide that the business activity—shipping the package—has a sufficient chance of success.  
  
There are two important things to note about risk mitigation:  

- It is impossible to remove risk. Never believe anyone who says that something has "zero risk" or that a control offers "100 percent security." Even with all possible controls placed on a business function, there will still remain some level of risk; we call this "residual risk." If the residual risk that remains *after* controls have been implemented falls within the organization's risk appetite, then the organization might choose to perform that function. If the remaining residual risk exceeds the risk appetite of the organization, the controls are insufficient or the business is just too risky to perform.
- The cost of the controls must be less than the potential benefit of the business process, or the process is not profitable or worthwhile. You should never put a $10 lock on a $5 bicycle.

The organization can (and should) should consider and use differing types of controls when choosing to mitigate risk. In the security field, we usually group controls into three general types: physical, technical, and administrative.  
  
Physical controls are controls that limit physical access to assets or that operate in a manner that reduces the impact of a physical event. Examples of physical controls include locks on doors, fire suppression equipment in datacenters, fences, and guards.  
  
Technical controls, also referred to as logical controls, are those controls that enhance some facets of the CIA triad, usually operating within a system, often in electronic fashion. Possible technical controls include encryption mechanisms, access control lists to limit user permissions, and audit trails and logs of system activity.  
  
Administrative controls are those processes and activities (necessarily not physical or technical) that provide some aspect of security. Examples: personnel background checks, scheduled routine log reviews, mandatory vacations, robust and comprehensive security policies and procedures, and designing business processes so that there are no single points of failure and so that proper separation of duties exists.  
  
Combining the types of controls is a good way to provide the organization with some defense in depth (also known as a layered defense); that is, require any malicious actor to overcome not just multiple controls, but multiple *kinds* of controls, so that more than one skillset would be necessary to access or acquire protected assets. Think of it this way: if we only used locks to protect material, and we put locks on external entrances, internal doors, and on a safe containing sensitive assets, then an intruder would still only need one skillset (lock picking) to acquire that material. Instead, if we combined the use of locks with guard patrols, intrusion sensors, and encryption, then someone who wanted unauthorized access or ownership of sensitive material would not only have to know lock picking, but use subterfuge and stealth as well as decryption to get those assets.  
  

Note

There is no reason you can't combine some of the various risk management methods, and it's actually a good practice to do so. For instance, an organization can implement risk controls to perform risk mitigation *and* buy insurance to transfer risk *and then* will still have to do risk acceptance when allowing for the residual risk. The only risk management option that can't be combined with  the others is risk avoidance, because avoiding the risk means not engaging in that business function, so there is nothing left to mitigate, transfer, or accept.

#### Risk Management Frameworks

Numerous risk management frameworks exist that are designed to assist the enterprise in developing sound risk management practices and management. However, for the purposes of the CCSP exam, we will only be discussing ISO 31000:2009, NIST 800-37, and the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) frameworks.  
  

The Numbers Used in the Names of the Frameworks

Lots of numbers are used when describing some these standards, models, and frameworks, so let's take a little closer look.  
  
You may be confused to sometimes see ISO/IEC as opposed to just ISO. ISO/IEC is a joint technical committee of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). When you see standards with both sets of letters, it means that they were jointly created by both organizations. When looking at an ISO standard or model, the first number, such as 31000, represents the number in the series, and the number after the colon, such as :2009, represents the last year the standard was revised. Additionally, ISO documents are not free. Some are more expensive than others, but they are sold as a means of supporting the organization and can be quite expensive. For more information, go to [ISO - International Organization for Standardization](http://www.iso.org/iso/home.html).  
  
In the case of NIST standards, they tend to use a *revision* number such as 800-53 r4. This means that it is the fourth revision of the document since it was originally written. Sometimes they include *SP* in their name, which stands for *Special Publication*. NIST documents are paid for by U.S. tax dollars and provided for free to the world. For more information, go to [Publications](https://www.nist.gov/publications).  
  
COBIT (Control Objectives for Information Technology) 5 means that it is the fifth version of COBIT to be released since it was created. The first edition of COBIT was created in 1996. COBIT is published by ISACA, and they charge for the documents. However, if you are an ISACA member, you are entitled to one free set; additional sets must be purchased. For more information, go to [ISACA](http://www.isaca.org).

**  
ISO 31000:2009**  
ISO 31000:2009 is an international standard that focuses on designing, implementing, and reviewing risk management processes and practices. The standard explains that proper implementation of a risk management process can be used to  

- Create and protect value
- Integrate organizational procedures
- Be part of the decision-making process
- Explicitly address uncertainty
- Be a systematic, structured, and timely risk management program
- Ensure the risk management program is based on the best available information
- Be tailored to the organization's business requirements and actual risks
- Take human and cultural factors into account
- Ensure the risk management program is transparent and inclusive
- Create a risk management program that is dynamic, iterative, and responsive to change
- Facilitate continual improvement and enhancement of the organization

For more information please visit [ISO 31000 Risk management](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/iso31000.htm).  
  
**NIST SP 800-37 (Guide for Implementing the Risk Management Framework)**  
NIST SP 800-37 is the Guide for Implementing the Risk Management Framework (RMF). This particular risk management framework is a methodology for handling all organizational risk in a holistic, comprehensive, and continual manner. This RMF supersedes the old "Certification and Accreditation" model of cyclical inspections that have a specific duration (used widely in the military, intelligence, and federal communities). This RMF relies heavily on the use of automated solutions, risk analysis and assessment, and implementing controls based on those assessments, with continuous monitoring and improvement.  
  
NIST SP 800-37 is a guide organizations can use to implement the RMF. Although NIST standards are developed for use by the federal government, they have begun to be accepted in many circles as best practices. For instance, companies in the United States may use the NIST model and publications in developing not only their information security program, but also their risk management program and practices. NIST publications and standards have the dual benefit of being widely acknowledged as expert and sensible, but also free of charge (all NIST documents are in the public domain). It takes little effort to adopt and adapt the NIST materials from their intended use in the federal space into use in a private sector or nonprofit endeavor.  
  
Keep in mind that these documents are not as accepted in international markets as are ISO/IEC standards. Therefore, if you conduct business outside the United States, you may want to investigate the other standards in more detail. Some overseas companies will not even do business with U.S. companies unless they subscribe to and are certified under ISO standards.

**European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA)**  
You could think of European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) as a European counterpart to NIST. It is a standard and model developed in Europe. While it is international in nature within the confines of Europe, it is not as globally accepted in the way ISO standards are.  
  
ENISA is responsible for producing *Cloud Computing: Benefits, Risks, and Recommendations for Information Security.* It identifies 35 types of risks organizations should consider but goes further by identifying the top eight security risks based on likelihood and impact:  

- Loss of governance
- Lock-in
- Isolation failure
- Compliance risk
- Management interface failure
- Data protection
- Malicious insider
- Insecure or incomplete data deletion

Note

If you are studying CCSP in a group environment, a useful exercise is to break up into three groups. Each group can take one of the three frameworks discussed, spend some time studying it, and then review the key points of each. When completed, join the other two groups and compare notes. Pay particular attention to how they differ in the United States as compared to Europe and the rest of the world.

#### Risk Management Metrics

To understand whether control mechanisms and policies are effective, it is important to identify risk management metrics that will reflect the effectiveness of your program. To do this, you can use what is referred to as a risk scorecard. These cards help you derive some relative value for risk of the activities for which you are engaged. They might, for instance, look something like this:  

1.  Critical
2.  High
3.  Moderate
4.  Low
5.  Minimal

Each of these levels would need to be defined so that risks could be adequately described. For instance, something that is critical (No. 5) might cause irrevocable reputational and financial damage, whereas something that is moderate (No. 4) might only cause some recoverable reputational and financial damage. Some companies even quantify these so there are actual dollar amounts attached to each. For example:  

- Critical => $100,000 in damages
- High => $50,000 but < $100,000

In addition, metrics may be attached to specific types of risk or damage, as shown in Figure 11.2.

#### Contracts and Service-Level Agreements (SLAs)

<a id="anno04GrR"></a>

The most important documents establishing, defining, and enforcing the relationship between the cloud provider and cloud customer are the contract and the service-level agreement (SLA). The contract describes in detail exactly what both parties' responsibilities are, what services are being contracted, and what provisions are in place for the safety, security, integrity, and availability of those same services. The SLA is the list of defined, specific, numerical metrics that will used to determine whether the provider is sufficiently meeting the contract terms during each period of performance.  
  
Perhaps the most important relationship between the two documents is that the contract stipulates the penalty imposed on the cloud provider if any metric of the SLA is not met during a certain performance period. For instance, if the period of performance is one month, and the SLA contains a metric that states, "Downtime will not exceed five (5) seconds per calendar month," and the cloud provider has six seconds of downtime in December, then the contract should allow the cloud customer to withhold payment for the cost that would otherwise be paid for that month, without any interruption of the continued service that is scheduled for January. This is a penalty imposed on the provider for failing to meet the needs of the customer, a sort of guarantee built into the contract and enforced on a periodic basis.  
  
Let's begin by examining some of the essential components and activities that might be expressed in the contract between a provider and customer:  

- Availability
- Performance
- Security and privacy of data
- Logging and reporting
- Data location
- Data format and structure
- Portability
- Identification and problem resolution
- Change management
- Dispute mediation
- Exit strategy options
- Components activity
- Uptime guarantees (the five 9s principle)
- Penalties (for both consumer and provider)
- Penalty exclusions (instances where penalties are not invoked)
- Suspension of service
- Provider liability
- Data protection requirements
- Disaster recovery
- Security recommendations

As you can see, this assortment of details about services can be quite comprehensive. And if the CCSP or the cloud customer does not complete their due diligence by carefully scrutinizing the details of the contract, you could find yourself in quite a pickle. There are many considerations for what should be in the contract, depending on the needs of the organization.  
  
The SLA, on the other hand, will assign specific numerical values to the performance objectives outlined in the contract. Using a sampling from the list of possible contract elements, the related SLA might include details like this:  

- The cloud customer will have full, constant access to the customer's accounts and data at all times, with an allowed exception of service interruption no greater than 24 hours per calendar quarter (where service interruption is the fault of the provider).
- Data moved to or from the provider's resources and control at the defined price will not exceed 40 gigabytes per hour; data movement exceeding this rate will incur additional costs as defined in the standard rate sheet included in the contract.
- Customer service inquiries from the customer to the provider will be addressed via direct email or telephone contact within three hours of transmission.

While both the contract and the SLA may contain numerical values, the SLA will expressly include numerical metrics used to determine that recurring performance goals are met.  
  
It's very important that the customer consider all possible situations and risks associated with the customer's business requirements when crafting and negotiating the contract and SLA. Suppose that the provider promises availability that amounts to no more than 24 hours of downtime in any given quarter. That seems pretty fair on the surface. But what if the customer is an online retailer who does 30 percent of their annual business the day after Thanksgiving, and that is the 24-hour period of an outage? It could devastate the customer's business and yet still be within the confines of the SLA.  
  
The written labs at the end of the lesson mention looking at a video of the CSA CTP protocol. In that video, you can see how customers can pick and choose the parameters of their individual SLA needs. The person who shuts down his or her business the day after Thanksgiving may not care at all about a day's outage. But the protocol will show you how to make better decisions about what you want in your SLA as opposed to just signing it without understanding what you are getting into.  
  
It is also important to look at the quality of the items delivered as part of your SLA. For instance, being connected and available is one thing, but if the servers at the other end are sluggish, customer experience may lag. If bandwidth is sluggish or there is jitter, again,  consumer experience suffers. So in your SLA you must also adequately address these  quality of service (QoS) issues. Here are some more examples:  

- Availability
- Outage duration
- Capacity metrics
- Performance metrics
- Storage device metrics
- Server capacity metrics
- Instance startup time metric
- Response time metric
- Completion time metric
- Mean time to switchover
- Storage capability
- Server scalability

  

Note

The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) has created an annual report on threats and has given them somewhat funny names. In 2013 the report was called *The Notorious Nine* and in 2016 it was named *The Treacherous 12*. Both names were due to the number of cloud computing threats or groups of threats that were identified that year. It is intended to let people know the nature of prevalent cloud threats, much like the OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Top Ten, which is a list of the top ten threats found or exposed in applications across the Internet.

6.3. Understand Audit Process, Methodologies, and Required Adaptations for a Cloud Environment

6.4. Understand Implications of Cloud to Enterprise Risk Management

<a id="anno04Grr"></a>Before entering into any type of contract for cloud computing services, the organization should evaluate a number of things. First, there should be some compelling reason for engaging the cloud provider. Decisions should be made that assist the business in reaching its long-term goals. They should never be made because they seem attractive or your competitors are doing it. You should have sound business reasons for deciding to use a cloud provider and for determining which one to choose.  
  
As part of the due diligence in looking at cloud computing as a viable solution for the business, a few more items should be examined. Perhaps not all business units need to be involved in decision making. Perhaps some changes will have little or no impact on them, in which case they do not need to be involved. This is called *scoping*, which is used to refer to including only departments or business units impacted by any cloud engagement.  
  
Another important aspect of evaluating cloud computing solution is that of regulatory compliance. It is vital that you investigate what regulators' expectations are with regard to cloud computing solutions and the additional or differing risks that engaging in the cloud solution will bring to the organization.  
  
Lastly, you must look closely at the costs associated with any types of disaster recovery or outage situations and what you are able to withstand. Measurements such as recovery time objective (RTO), recovery point objective (RPO), and maximum allowable downtime (MAD) are critical in making decisions about choosing cloud computing solutions. You must be able to withstand certain amounts of outages based on your risk profile as they are bound to occur at some time. Knowing how to handle them and how your cloud provider will handle them is imperative.

### Cloud Contract Design and Management for Outsourcing

![certification_objective](:/b7105d9c0215439cad1385c288b1d070)

Exam Objectives

6\. Legal & Compliance

6.5. Understand Outsourcing and Cloud Contract Design

<a id="anno04GrS"></a>It is important that things like appropriate governance be involved in contract design and management of outsourcing. An in-depth understanding of contracts and contract management is important and in large enterprises is often managed by a separate department. It is the CCSP's responsibility to ensure that these contract managers understand the details of what they are managing so that the organization does not incur undue risk.  
  
One example of adequate governance is how often contracts are renewed. This can and should be on at least an annual basis (if not sooner should there be problems). Items such as how conflicts will be resolved are also an important factor. In other words, what happens when the relationship between the customer and consumer hits a bump?  
  
Two other vitally important aspects of contracts have to do with the notion of data portability and vendor lock-in. *Vendor lock-in* is getting stuck with a certain provider, generally either as a result of detrimental contract terms or technical limitations. Data portability is the trait customers seek in order to avoid lock-in. *Data portability* is the term used to describe the ease of moving data from one cloud provider to another (or away from the cloud provider and back to a legacy enterprise environment). The greater the portability of the data, the less chance of vendor lock-in.  
  
If you choose to stop doing business with your cloud vendor, what happens to your data? Is it transportable? Can you move it to another provider? Will the data be in some type of universal format so it usable? Will you have a reasonable amount of time to move your data should conflicts go unresolved? And what will happen to your data once you leave the provider? Have you or they made arrangements for adequate data deletion using such techniques as crypto-shredding? These questions are all important things to consider when managing outsourcing contracts.

### Identifying Appropriate Supply Chain and Vendor Management Processes

![certification_objective](:/b7105d9c0215439cad1385c288b1d070)

Exam Objectives

6\. Legal & Compliance

6.6. Execute Vendor Management

<a id="anno04Grs"></a>When discussing supply chain and vendor management in the realm of cloud computing, we are talking about things that bring risk into the equation. For instance, while relying on legacy internal servers to deliver application to end users, outages can be handled very quickly as there is usually staff standing by to correct problems. In a cloud scenario, the cloud vendor may only be providing IaaS, and as a result, when you have application problems, getting to the cloud environment to correct them could be more problematic.  
  
In addition, other factors such as availability come into play in a cloud. In looking at a supply chain, several parties may be involved in delivering your cloud service:  

- Cloud carriers (the ISPs between the cloud customer and the cloud provider)
- Platform provider (the vendors supplying the operating systems used in the cloud service)
- Application provider (the vendors supplying the software used in the cloud service)

These can all be different entities making up the supply chain. Should any one of these become unavailable for some reason or cause problems in accessing resources, you have a problem. These are risks associated with supply chain management and must be handled accordingly.  
  
To adequately understand your risk exposure, you must first and foremost understand your SLAs and your provider's abilities to make good on them.  
  
In addition to the items listed earlier, the service-level agreement should further contain these elements:  

- Performance
- Security and privacy protections
- Logging and reporting
- Disaster recovery metrics  
    - Recovery time objectives (RTOs)
    - Maximum period of tolerable disruption (MPTD)
- Location of data
- Data format and structure
- Data portability
- Problem identification and resolution procedures
- Change management process
- Dispute mediation process
- Exit expectations

<a id="04GrT"></a>

#### Common Criteria Assurance Framework (ISO/IEC  15408-1:2009)

Common Criteria Assurance Framework (ISO/IEC 15408-1:2009) is yet another international standard designed to provide assurances for security claims by vendors. It establishes a common criterion for evaluating those items.  
  
The primary goal is to ensure customers that security products they purchase have been thoroughly tested by independent third-party testers and meet the requirements the customer has specified.  
  
One thing to keep in mind is that the certification of the product only certifies its capabilities. If misconfigured or mismanaged, it is no more secure than anything else the customer might use.  
  
For more information visit about the Common Criteria and ISO/IEC 15408-1:2009, go to [ISO/IEC 15408-1:2009](http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=50341).

<a id="04Grt"></a>

#### Cloud Computing Certification

The Cloud Certification Schemes List (CCSL) provides an overview of different existing certification schemes. It describes the main characteristics relevant to cloud computing and cloud computing customers. It also attempts to answer questions such as the following in an effort to provide the customer with adequate knowledge in order to make a well-informed decision about a cloud provider:  

- Which are the underlying standards?
- Who issues the cert?
- Is the CSP audited?
- Who conducts the audits (internal vs. external)?

The schemes that make up the CCSL are as follows:  

- Certified Cloud Service – TUV Rhineland
- CSA Attestation – OCF Level 2
- CSA Certification Level 2
- CSA Self-Assessment – OCF Level 1
- EuroCloud Self-Assessment (ECSA Self-Assessment)
- EuroCloud Star Audit Certification (ECSA Audit)
- Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) v3.2
- LEET Security Rating Guide
- AICPA SOC 1
- AICPA SOC 2
- AICPA SOC 3

The Cloud Certification Schemes Metaframework (CCSM) is an extension of the CCSL designed to provide a high-level mapping of security requirements of the customer to security objectives in existing cloud security schemes.  
  
The first version of the CCSM was released in 2014 and can be accessed from the following URL: [https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification/list-of-cloud-certification-schemes/cloud-certification-schemes-metaframework](https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification/list-of-cloud-certification-schemes/cloud-certification-schemes-metaframework).  
  
There are 27 CCSM security objectives that the customer can select to cross-reference against. A resultant comparison matrix might look something like Table 11.1.  

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |Table 11-1: A comparison matrix

<a id="04GrU"></a>

#### CSA Security, Trust, and Assurance Registry (STAR)

The CSA STAR program, initiated in 2011, appeared as demand for a single consistent framework for evaluating cloud providers developed. Several other frameworks were floating around, but there was no single source where customers could go and see how a cloud provider rated with regard to the framework.  
  
The CSA STAR program was designed to provide an independent level of program assurance for cloud consumers. It is based on three levels of assurance, covers four offerings, and consists of a comprehensive set of cloud-centric control objectives.  
  
The CSA STAR is a complementary registry of security controls provided by popular cloud computing offerings and is designed for users to assess cloud providers, security providers, and advisory and assessment service firms as part of their vendor management due diligence in choosing providers.  
  
The CSA STAR consists of the two following components:  

- **Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM):** A list of security controls and principles appropriate for the cloud environment, cross-referenced to other control frameworks such as COBIT, ISO standards, and NIST pubs. You can download a copy of the current CCM from CSA at [link](https://downloads.cloudsecurityalliance.org/assets/research/cloud-controls-matrix/CSA_CCM_v.3.0.1-10-06-2016.xlsx).
- **Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ):** A self-assessment performed by cloud providers, detailing their evaluation of the practice areas and control groups they use in providing their services. You can download a copy of the current CAIQ from CSA at [Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire v3.0.1 (9-1-17 Update)](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/download/consensus-assessments-initiative-questionnaire-v3-0-1/). You can also review completed CAIQs and certifications for various cloud providers in the CSA's STAR registry online at [CSA Security, Trust & Assurance Registry (STAR)](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/star/#_registry).

The CSA STAR program also consists of three levels based on the Open Certification Framework (see Figure 11.3):  
  

<img width="610" height="276" src=":/e1d632bd2aa6479895f413cff5a24a28"/>

Figure 11.3: The Cloud Security Alliance Open Certification Framework  
© 2017 Cloud Security Alliance. All Rights Reserved  
  

- **Level One: Self-Assessment:** Requires the release and publication of due diligence assessments against the CSA's *Consensus Assessment Initiative Questionnaire and/or Cloud Matrix (CCM)*
- **Level Two: CSA STAR Attestation:** Requires the release and publication of available results of an assessment carried out by an independent third party based on CSA CCM and ISO 27001:2013 or an AICPA SOC 2
- **Level Three: CSA STAR Continuous Monitoring:** Requires the release and publication of results related to the security properties of monitoring based on the CloudTrust Protocol

Note

There have been several iterations of the CCM, with the most recent and default being CCM v3.0.1 effective October 2016.

  
Much like the SOC reports discussed in Lesson 10, these levels are representative of varying degrees of compliance with the framework. Involving independent third-party assessors can be quite expensive, and only large providers can usually absorb the cost as they typically also have a large investment in their security infrastructure.

<a id="04Gru"></a>

#### Supply Chain Risk

When evaluating supply chain risk, the customer should be thinking of disaster recovery and business continuity: What happens if something goes south with one or more of these vendors on which your business depends? You might also look at it like a network where interdependencies are everywhere. You cannot afford to have any major outages, so you build in redundancy where it makes good sense. The same is true of the supply chain. Remember the old saying, *don't put all your eggs in one basket*.  
  
Some common supply chain risks are:  

- Financial instability of provider
- Single points of failure
- Data breaches
- Malware infestations
- Data loss

Even more common than folks would like to think are natural disasters. What if the datacenter of your cloud provider is destroyed by an act of nature like the tsunami in Japan several years ago?  
  
As you are aware you cannot, nor should you attempt to, reduce all risks. Some are simply too large. When risks are too large to remove, you need to look to other means such as transferring the risk or avoiding the risk. Risk can be avoided by not engaging in the activity. Insurance is one form of transferring some of the risk. This is often done in situations where the likelihood of a disaster is rather small but the consequences could be catastrophic, such as in the event of a fire or tornado.  
  
ISO 28000:2007 defines a set of security management requirements, including those that must be applied to all parties within a supply chain. However, the responsibility of ensuring the suitability of each vendor in the supply chain for meeting those requirements and enforcing them up and down the supply chain is squarely on the shoulders of the contracting organization. In other words, if you pay someone else to perform a service that in any way might affect your customers, you are obligated to ensure that the entities you've paid are subject to governance equivalent to what you've promised your customers and that those entities are following that governance. ISO 28000:2007 also provides for a certification against certain elements that relate to supply chain risk:  

- Security management policy
- Organizational objectives
- Risk management practices
- Documented practices and records
- Supplier relationships
- Roles, responsibilities, and authorities
- Organizational procedures and processes

As the standard grows in popularity with cloud providers, it will in all likelihood be more widely adopted in the future. Much like the STAR Registry, ISO certification gives the consumer some level of assurance that the appropriate controls are in place to secure data and privacy.

### Written Labs

<a id="anno04GrW"></a>

1.  Go to the CSA website and read the detailed description of the [CSA STAR](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/star/) program. Be sure you understand the three levels in the Open Certification Framework. Then attempt to identify at least three cloud  service providers who have met the requirements and write down their names.  
      
    
    The CSA Star program and Open Certification Framework have been widely adopted. While many cloud providers meet their requirements, not all have, so it is still important to confirm this.
    
2.  Go to the following URL and watch the video demo of the CSA CloudTrust Protocol (CTP): [https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/group/cloudtrust-protocol/](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/group/cloudtrust-protocol/).  
      
    
    This video of the CloudTrust Protocol is just one of many useful resources provided by the Cloud Security Alliance. Be sure to explore their website in detail.
    
3.  Name and describe at least two major risk management frameworks.  
      
    
    Answers will vary and might include NIST's 800-37 (Risk Management Framework), COSO, and COBIT.
    
4.  Describe the primary difference between risk appetite and risk tolerance.  
      
    
    Risk appetite and risk tolerance are two terms that are very similar and are often used synonymously. The difference is nuanced. An organization's risk appetite and risk tolerance can be looked at as reflecting their attitude toward the benefits and levels of danger that a particular risk poses.
    
5.  Name at least two important factors in reviewing an SLA.  
      
    
    Answers will vary and might include throughput, per-use prices, the customer's business drivers, BC/DR considerations, portability, and more.
